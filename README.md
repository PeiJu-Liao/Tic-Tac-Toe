# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple game which is created by JavaScript.\

## Makes the game better
It's the simple initial project of the Tic-Tac-Toe game.\
However, I would like to improve the game in some ways as below :  
* Make the diffculty classifications of game.(easy/medium/hard)
* More CSS animation.(ex:screen fade in/fade out...)
* Maybe the player character selection before the gane start.
